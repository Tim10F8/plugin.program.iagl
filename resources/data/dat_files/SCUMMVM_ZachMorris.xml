    <plot>Astro Chicken is an arcade minigame in Space Quest III. Gameplay consists of attempting to land a chicken on a trampoline. The mechanics of the game are similar to those of Lunar Lander, with the exception that the chicken rebounds unharmed if it strikes the trampoline too forcefully. Achieving a high score reveals a hidden distress message left by the Two Guys from Andromeda. The Astro Chicken theme music is a variation on Chicken Reel, a traditional folk song best known for its use in animated cartoons. Sierra released the Astro Chicken minigame as a demo to promote Space Quest III.</plot>

    <plot>Backyard Soccer is the first game in the Backyard Sports Soccer series. Gameplay is simple: there are 30 kids to pick on a team, and many custom color teams to create. You also get to be in two game types: Single in which you play one small game and Season play, in which you play for a whole a lot of time and features you playing against some unusable custom teams. This game also includes a practice mode to help you get used to the kicking in the game, and also shows what it is like during a penalty. All rules to soccer including fouls and hat tricks, are included in the game. When picking the kids on your team you will want to read about how good they are - don't just pick a kid cause they look cool.</plot>

    <plot>In Blue's Clues- Blue's Birthday Adventure, spotted puppy Blue and her human friend Steve prepare for Blue's birthday party. Four questions are posed to the player- What does Blue want to do at her party? What does Blue want to play at her party? What does Blue want to give her guests at her party? What does Blue want to eat at her party? As in the Blue's Clues television show that the characters are based on and in Blue's Treasure Hunt, each question can be solved by discovering clues indicated by blue paw prints. As each set of three clues is collected, Steve retires to his thinking chair to ponder the clues, and the player must select the most likely combination from a group of three pictures. The player's reward is the party itself with a special activity dictated by the question that was solved. There are two discs, each one covering two questions, or pathways - each pathway is a complete game, and can be played independently of the others, in any order. There are nine directed activities in the game- Find My Friend Tickety's Puzzles Pizza Making Flower Picking Party Toys Hide and Seek Find Turquoise Treasure Hunt Mixed-up Music These activities are set to an intermediate difficulty level as a default, and will adjust automatically up as a level is completed, or down if the player seems to be having a problem. They can also be set manually from the Pathway selection screen. In addition, there are some purely creative play activities that don't have difficulty levels, such as choosing a gift for Blue and selecting puppets and scenery for the puppet show. As in other Blue's Clues games gameplay uses the mouse to point, click and drag. Parents can view a printable progress report available from the sign-in screen, which shows what activities and at what levels the user has played.</plot>

    <plot>This is another Blue's Clues CD-ROM game from Humongous Entertainment, which features the USA Blue's characters including video footage of the human character Steve. This two CD game allows multiple pre-school kids to each have their own settings, by entering names. The game is controlled by the mouse, with plenty of things to click on. The images are a collection of real-world, clay, and paper - just like the Blue's Clues TV show. And, of course, there are paw prints to find. In this game, you help Blue and Steve enter the Land of Great Discovery. To do so, you must complete three unique treasure hunts (these can change each time), multi-level pre-school learning, a Blue skidoo and lots of locations. Activities include- - Bedtimes Stories (early reading, rhyming, storytelling) - Catch the leaves (simple motor skills) - Mixed-up Painting (Visual id and discrimination skills) - Find The Numbers (Number/Color id, inductive reasoning) - Which Pictures (logical thinking, listening, verbal/visual cues) - Magenta's Photo Album (sequencing, storytelling) - Lights On! (visual memory, visual discrimination) - Painting ( creative expression, color recognition)</plot>

    <plot>In the beginning of the 21st century, Earth is experiencing a global oil shortage. Surprisingly, Tunisia remains one of the few countries still in possession of large quantities of high-quality oil. USA and Soviet governments race each other in their attempts to purchase as much oil as possible. Finally, the Soviets take a step further and kidnap the US ambassador, hoping to provoke an international incident. Naval Officer Johnny Westland is sent to Tunisia with the order of rescuing the ambassador and preventing further escalation of the conflict.[CR]Code-Name: Iceman is primarily an adventure game similar to Sierra's other works in that genre. The player navigates the protagonist in eight different directions from third-person view, and types text commands to interact with the environment. The command "Look" may be typed separately and lead to different text descriptions depending on where on screen the protagonist is positioned. The game is similar to Police Quest series in that it relies on realistic procedures, in this case military instructions, first aid, etc. The player may reach dead ends and resort to restoring an earlier save if some of these procedures are not followed properly. In addition, a considerable portion of the game consists of submarine simulation, requiring the player to navigate a submarine and fight enemy craft.</plot>

    <plot>It is the ninth century, and Camelot, the legendary castle ruled by King Arthur, has fallen under a curse. Famine and drought plague the kingdom because of the love triangle between the king, his wife Gwenhyver, and the knight Launcelot. It appears that only the mysterious Holy Grail can restore Camelot, and three knights - Launcelot, Gawaine, and Galahad - embark on a journey to find it, and soon disappear without trace. King Arthur leaves his castle in search of the missing knights, hoping to locate the Grail as well. His quest takes him to real and mythical locations in England, and later to Jerusalem and other areas of the Holy Land.Conquests of Camelot is an adventure game that requires the player to input text commands, mostly by combining verbs and objects (such as "look man", "take purse", etc.). A few commands (such as "ask about") have keyboard shortcuts. Unlike most other adventures, the game does not focus extensively on inventory-based puzzles. Rather, it presents a diverse array of tasks depending on concrete situations. These involve exploration, solving riddles, gathering information, participating in arcade sequences such as jousting, and others. Rudimentary money management is present as well. Many problems have different solutions, and it is possible to reach the final part of the game even without having completed some of the essential quests (e.g. failing to save the knights). However, Arthur is being judged by the game in three different categories: skill (referring to the action sequences), wisdom (evaluating the amount of cultural information gathered), and soul (determining the moral value of Arthur's action). Failure to achieve a high score in the last category leads to a bad ending.The game is set in a concrete historical period, but adds an alternate reality to it, assuming that pagan deities really existed, but were overshadowed by Christian worship. However, there are only a few references to real religious practices of the time or any historical characters.</plot>

    <plot>Purple Tentacle, one of the crazy Dr. Fred's creations, drinks contaminated water from Dr. Fred's Sludge-o-matic. He mutates into an insane genius and grows arms, and now he's plotting to take over the world. In an effort to stop him, Dr. Fred sends three friends, Bernard, Hoagie and Laverne back in time to yesterday, in order for them to turn off the Sludge-o-matic and stop the sludge from spilling into the river, thus preventing the whole incident. Naturally, the cheap doctor uses a fake diamond over a real one in his time machine, which blows up sending Hoagie 200 years into the past and Laverne 200 years into the future. Now the player must bring back Hoagie and Laverne, with the help of the time machine's ability to move objects between time periods, and then stop evil Purple from taking over the world.Day of the Tentacle is a point-and-click adventure game and a sequel to Maniac Mansion. The player controls Bernard, and later also Hoagie and Laverne, being able to switch between them at any time. By using the commands at the bottom of the screen, the character can pick up items, use them on other things, talk to people and more. Any of the three friends can also send his items across time to another friend. The game takes place in the same area, but in three different eras, and thus affecting history takes a vital part in some puzzles. For instance, Hoagie can hide an item in the 18th century, and Laverne discovers it in the 23rd century - but by then, the item may have been affected by time and changed its properties. The CD version of the game contains voice-overs for all the dialogues.</plot>

    <plot>This adventure game puts the player in the shoes of Rincewind, a wizard whose sole purpose in life is to stay alive. He appears to be very good at it as well, because apparently the universe has decided to continuously challenge him. The game takes place in the humorous fantasy world created by Terry Pratchett. The world is called the Discworld, as it is actually a flat disc carried on the backs of four gigantic elephants, which themselves stand on the back of an even larger turtle.The story is loosely based on the novel "Guards! Guards!". Both in the book and the game, a dragon is summoned by a group of mysterious conspirators and now terrorizes the city state of Ankh-Morpork. Being the most expendable wizard of the Unseen University, Rincewind is given the task to get rid of the beast (only in the game though; in the book, the city's nightwatch has to deal with the problem).Discworld is a classical point-and-click adventure game with a few original features. For example, Rincewind's inventory is limited to two objects, and the majority of his belongings is stored in the Luggage, an intelligent chest with dozens of little feet. Furthermore, at a certain point in the game the player gains access to a time-traveling device and has to send Rincewind to the past and back in order to solve some of the puzzles.</plot>

    <plot>Bert is a young dragon that lives with his parents Berta and Herbert in a magical land, where dragons got civilized, started to wear clothes and live peacefully with humans. One day, Herbert suddenly disappears, with rumors saying the he left his wife and son behind to search for a lost treasure. Meanwhile, a magical wand called Eveline decides to rule the world out of boredom, using Bert to cast a petrifying spell on the marionettes of a traveling puppeteer and cause other mischief among the local population. Now, Bert must fix all the trouble caused by Eveline, and search for his missing father.[CR]Drac Historie is a Czech point-and-click adventure game, originally the first Czech CD game ever to be published in 1995, and later released as open-source freeware in 2006 by the original developer. It follows the standards of the genre, where the main objective is to collect a series of scenery objects and use them to solve puzzles. The inventory shows the interior of a brown sack, and can be accessed by placing the cursor on the top of the screen. A map showing an overhead view of the land can be summoned by positioning the cursor at the bottom. New places are automatically added to the map as the player explores the surroundings, allowing instantaneous travel to any of the previously visited locations.[CR]The dialogue with other characters uses the branching tree system implemented by several other games, where multiple questions and answers appear listed as options at the bottom and the player has to select one of them. There is no menu with verbs, instead all the actions are performed with the right mouse button, while the left one is used to get descriptions of objects and portions of the scenery.</plot>

    <plot>The young Callash has been just crowned the king of Gran Callahach. Twenty years ago the land was in grave peril, as the evil sorcerer Sanwe planned to conquer and ruin it. But he old king's court wizard Ner-Tom magically imprisoned Sanwe using the powers of the Dragonsphere spell. The sorcerer swore to avenge his humiliation once the spell's energy runs out. Now, this time has come, and the young hero must defeat Sanwe before he breaks free. As he approaches the sorcerer's prison, he is yet to realize that dealing with Sanwe will lead to startling realizations concerning his own self, and unravel a new sinister plot.[CR]Dragonsphere is a graphic adventure in the classic third-person LucasArts and Sierra style, and the third adventure game by MicroProse, similar visually and gameplay-wise to Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender. The interaction with the game world is performed by applying one of the ten different verb commands to objects and people. Additionally, each object has several unique, specific verb commands that can be applied giving the player quite a number of possible combinations of object usage and sometimes more straight forward resolution to the problem. The game contains vast amounts of unique text responses to player's actions and branching dialogue with characters. Some of them are fatal for the main character so they need to be chosen wisely or accordingly to the presented facts and observations. The puzzles are, for the most part, inventory-based. The game features hand-painted backgrounds and some digitized animation.</plot>

    <plot>In EcoQuest: The Search for Cetus, the player is cast into the role of Adam, the twelve-year-old son of the famous ecologist Noah Greene. One day, his father rescues a dolphin from an abandoned fish net. As Adam becomes more friendly with the creature, he is amazed to discover that the dolphin can talk! Adam finds out that his new friend is Delphineus, the messenger of the whale king Cetus.

    <plot>In Lost Secret of the Rainforest the player controls a boy named Adam Greene who, along with his father Noah, a doctor of ecology, travels to the town Iquitos in South America, to meet the Ecology Emergency Network. The two intend to go on an expedition up the Amazon river and try to establish contact with a native tribe known as the Grove People. After having separated from his father, Adam must venture into the rainforest, discover the secret of the mysterious Forest Heart and find the lost City of Gold in his pursuit of a remedy for the Grove People. This sequel to EcoQuest- The Search for Cetus is similar to its predecessor in presentation and gameplay, being an adventure game with educational elements. Like the first game, it has an icon-based interface and does not allow the player to get irrevocably stuck in the game or let the player character die. A specific feature of this installment is the so-called Ecorder, a device Adam uses to record information about the flora and fauna of the area he explores.</plot>

    <plot>Elvira - a horror movie star, a witch, and your girlfriend - is in trouble. A demon Cerberus has kidnapped her in order to kill her and gain her power. To save Elvira, you arrive at the studios of Black Widow Productions, where she is being held. Unfortunately, the whole studio is filled with monsters, as the horror movie sets have turned real. Elvira II- The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.). For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the room icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases. As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve. Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don't waste them.</plot>

    <plot>A writer named Adrienne Delaney has just moved into an old mansion with her photographer husband Donald. Shortly after moving in, Adrienne begins to experience horrifying nightmares and have odd encounters inside the creepy old abode. Furthermore, the house is having a severe effect on her husband, changing him for the worse. Adrienne must discover the secret of the house before the unknown force consumes her husband, and unravel the terrible events that have happened in the past.[CR]Phantasmagoria is an adventure game that places heavy emphasis on full motion video for exposition and cutscenes at various junctures to advance the storyline. Adrienne is represented as a digitized character roaming around pre-rendered settings in the house. She inspects various rooms, finds items, adds them to her inventory, finds places to use the items, and triggers advancements in the plot. [CR]Puzzle-solving element is present, though reduced compared to most other adventure games made by Sierra. There are seven chapters in the game, as well as a status screen that tracks the players progress within the chapter. If the player happens to get stuck in the game, a talking skull icon who identifies himself as the hintkeeper can supply the player with hints on request. It is possible to start playing the game from any chapter.</plot>

    <plot>Designed by Space Quest fan, Jeff Stewart, SQ0:Replicated was delivered for public consumption in 2003, the second full length Space Quest fan game to be released.[CR]A prequel to Space Quest 2, but set before Space Quest 1, it is written in AGI and uses a parser input system similar to that of Space Quest 1 and 2.[CR]SQ0 offers fans an untold tale of Roger Wilco from the days before Space Quest 1, as our hero finds himself posted aboard Labion Orbital Station 10, a Class 3 Cloning Facility. Unfortunately, it appears that a mysterious someone (or something) has murdered all of Roger's fellow crewmates during one of his famous supply-closet naps.[CR]Join Roger as he escapes the station, travels to Labion for the first time, manages to die in literally dozens of creative new ways as he struggles to figure out just what happened aboard LOS10 and—if he plays his cards right—save the universe from a fate too terrible to mention.</plot>

    <plot>Fatty Bears Birthday Surprise is the second video game made by Humongous Entertainment (the first being Putt-Putt Joins the Parade) and the first and only of the Fatty Bear point and click adventure games, though the character was also used in the mini-game compilation Fatty Bears Fun Pack and the crossover spinoff Putt-Putt and Fatty Bears Activity Pack, which was a combination of the previous game as well as a similar game featuring HEs character Putt-Putt. It was released in 1993 on both floppy disks and CD-ROM for DOS and Macintosh as well as the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. The game was later re-released in 1995 and contained a Windows/Mac/DOS-compatible disc.</plot>

    <plot>In Fatty Bear's FunPack, you play against Fatty Bear in either Reversi (a classic game of strategy and logic), Lines and Boxes ( a childhood classic involving a grid of dots and the players draw lines to create boxes), and the card game Go Fish. Designed for kids 3-8, each of these games has 4 difficulty levels. In addition, you can play Tangrams, a centuries-old game where are shown a shape and given a number of smaller pieces and have to put them together to make the shape. The game gets harder as you progress. Finally, there is the Fatty Bear's Paint Set activity, which has 35 pictures to color. Although there are 5 basic colors in the palette, you can also mix up different colors - even different shades.</plot>

    <plot>In 1949, Joe King, pilot for hire and owner of the Amazon Queen airplane which he uses for his work, arrives at a hotel in Rio de Janeiro to transport his next customer, famous film actress Faye Russel, only to be ambushed by his Dutch rival Anderson. Locked in a hotel room and trapped by Anderson's goons, Joe quickly gains assistance from Lola, a showgirl at the hotel and a former love interest, and escapes, making it back to the airport with his mechanic Sparky, just in time to stop his rival taking Faye. Wasting no time, Joe quickly pilots the Amazon Queen towards the location of Faye's shoot, only for a storm to cause him to crash-land in the Amazon jungle. After getting Faye and Sparky to safety, Joe begins searching for help, soon encountering a parrot named Wedgewood with a message for help. Seeking out the person the message was for, Joe meets with Trader Bob, who soon asks for his help in rescuing a princess named Azura from Floda, a lederhosen company that Bob suspects is a cover for something sinister[CR]Joe quickly begins searching for the jungle, encountering an entire tribe of Amazon women who capture him and took in Faye when she decided to seek help herself. Released by the tribe, Joe agrees to help them rescue Azura as well. Finding the princess within a hidden base beneath Floda, Joe frees her and returns to her tribe, only to find himself coming face-to-face with Floda's leader - Dr. Frank Ironstein, a mad scientist who seeks to conquer the world by turning Amazon women into dinosaur warriors through the use of his DinoRay invention. Seeing that Joe was smart to get around his security, Ironstein coerces him into helping him find an artifact from a temple that he requires known as the Crystal Skull, threatening to harm Azura if he doesn't. Left with no choice, Joe agrees, and heads for the temple, navigating traps and puzzles and eventually finding what he needs. Returning it to Ironstein, Joe quickly finds himself betrayed and trapped in Floda's base, but soon escapes and goes after Ironstein with the help of Anderson, his rival having originally been hired by the scientist to assist but later deciding to turn against him. Heading into the valley, Joe assists in trying to find Ironstein and manages to stop him, saving the day, before taking the scientist's Zeppelin and flying into the sunset.</plot>

    <plot>Joe King is the hero of this point and click adventure. His plane is carrying actress Faye Russell when it crash lands in a remote jungle, and he must battle through 100 screens of adventure and puzzle. The game's feel is influenced by hammy B-movies, and the characters are quite stereotyped and comic. As standard in point and click adventures, a set of icons at the bottom of the screen allow you to interact with visible characters and items in the main view area.</plot>

    <plot>Full Throttle is a graphic adventure game developed by LucasArts and designed by Tim Schafer. The game was released on April 20, 1995 for MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. It was Schafer's first game as project lead and head writer and designer, after having worked on other LucasArts titles including The Secret of Monkey Island (1990), Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge (1991), and Day of the Tentacle (1993). Set in the near future, the game's story follows Ben, the leader of a biker gang, who is framed for the murder of a beloved motorcycle manufacturing mogul and seeks to clear his and his gang's names. A remastered version of the game was developed by Double Fine Productions and was released in April 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita.[CR]Full Throttle was LucasArts' eleventh adventure game overall and the tenth to use the company's in-house game engine, SCUMM. It featured full motion video and action sequences, using LucasArts' INSANE animation engine, which was previously utilized in Star Wars: Rebel Assault II: The Hidden Empire. It was the first LucasArts game to be released for Microsoft Windows and the first to be distributed only on CD-ROM. It also introduced a contextual pie menu through which the player controls interactions with objects and characters. In contrast to other computer games of the era, which mostly relied on in-house talent for their voice acting, Full Throttle used mostly professional voice actors, including Roy Conrad as Ben, Mark Hamill as the villainous Adrian Ripburger, Hamilton Camp as the elderly Malcolm Corley, and Kath Soucie as Ben's ally Maureen. It was one of the few LucasArts games to use licensed music, featuring songs by San Francisco-area rock band The Gone Jackals.</plot>

    <plot>The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery is a direct sequel to Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, the first in the supernatural mystery adventure series telling the story of a bookstore owner and writer Gabriel Knight, the last offspring of generations of Schattenjaegers (shadow hunters), whose task is to fight the evil forces that abound in the world.[CR]After leaving New Orleans, Gabriel moves to the Ritter Castle in Bavaria, Germany, his family heritage. One day, a group of peasants approach the castle, and the elder tells Gabriel about a terrible death of a little girl, who was killed by a vicious wolf. Suspecting the wolf could be a supernatural creature, the peasant asks the Schattenjaeger to purge the evil. The investigation brings Gabriel and his assistant Grace Nakimura to the mysterious Hunter Society and to Bavaria's dark past.[CR]The game utilizes a cast of live actors and full-motion video technology: the actors are filmed over photorealistic images of Munich and its surroundings, and nearly every interaction with the environment leads to a FMV sequence. Despite its visual style, The Beast Within is not an interactive movie, but a full-fledged adventure game with many dialogues, detective work to do, and puzzles to solve. Unlike the first game, it is entirely controlled through point-and-click actions - all the icons have been replaced by a single cursor. Both Gabriel and Grace are available as playable characters during different chapters of the story.</plot>

Created by Jane Jensen, the game differs from Sierras Quest games (e.g. Space Quest) by having a realistic setting and focusing (despite its supernatural elements and humor) on mature themes and detective work. In this way it is more similar to the companys earlier Laura Bow games. [CR]The games icon-based interface is the same as in Sierras previous titles, with verb commands that allow interaction with the game world and its inhabitants. Though the game still has plenty of inventory-based puzzles characteristic for classic adventure, its gameplay is heavily inclined towards dialogue.

    <plot>UFOs (released as Gnap in Europe) is a fun point-and-click cartoon adventure in the same vein as Toonstruck, except a lot shorter and not as clever. Gordon Aplin's review at Quandary says it all:[CR]Gnap is a one-eyed, purple sausage-like alien who crash lands in a pigpen somewhere in the Ozarks. In need of parts to repair his space ship, he sets off to explore his surroundings. He is soon joined by of all things a platypus who, despite suffering some necessary but violent mishaps, refuses to be separated from Gnap. Between them, they might just get Gnap out of here.[CR]The game scenes fill the screen (every game should do this) and like most things animated are colourful and expressive. Not as vibrant as Stupid Invaders, but good to look at nonetheless. The denizens of the Ozarks are a motley hillbilly bunch, unattractive in both looks and temper. Even the animals pack a punch, or a peck. Only the pigs seem to lack the capacity to strike back. The bar room bikers are only slightly more appealing. The occupants of Cityville are somewhat more wholesome, but largely by comparison. However the freak show/dance party in the final scenes takes the cake.</plot>

    <plot>The game (according to the backcover (box/folder/manual) of the Atari 8-bit family and Apple II original and rerelease versions) takes place in the land of Serenia where King George's daughter Princess Priscilla has been kidnapped by an evil wizard named Harlin. Harlin has held her inside his castle far in the mountains. The King has offered half of his kingdom to anyone brave enough to travel to the Wizard's castle, defeat him and return his daughter. The player assumes the role of a happy wanderer who answers this challenge.[CR]The re-releases (Apple II, Atari 8-bit, and C64) contained additional plot added to the manual explaining how the wanderer made it to Serenia in the first place; some time long into the future after Harlin had been defeated by the Wanderer, he challenged the player to again repeat the actions leading to his defeat. He boasted of using his magic to change the world creating obstacles for anyone who would challenge him (he moved the desert around the village of Daventry, the northern sea splitting Serenia in two, and Great Mountains in the North on his half of the continent). He turned back the sands of time leaving the adventurer in the desert just outside the village of Serenia. He mocks the hero telling him that he may have been defeated once, but he couldn't be defeated a second time. The princess gives the hero some words of advice and a computer to help him defeat Harlin, and tells him he has become the wanderer (grandfather paradox and bootstrap paradox). The manual story as reprinted was also included with the Roberta Williams Collection (a compilation of games from Roberta Williams) and the King's Quest Collection Series (one of the compilations of King's Quest games).[CR]The introduction for Adventure of Serenia, explained that the adventurer, with the help of a computer, had magically transported to Serenia to save the Princess.</plot>

You need to find a way past them as well as the many obstacles on sea and land if you are to be successful.[CR]Along the bottom of the screen is a text parser which accepts two word commands to interact with the game, and at the top (covering most of the screen) are graphics depicting your current situation. If needed, the graphics can temporarily be cleared to see some of the most recent commands entered.</plot>

    <plot>Six board games are transformed to the computer screen in the third Hoyle's release. Snakes and Ladders, Backgammon, Yacht / Yahtzee, Checkers, Dominoes and Pachisi / Parcheesi all feature, with animated graphics and sound effects. As there is no time-sensitive action, and the game rules are familiar, these packs were designed to appeal to a wider range of people than most computer games. At least one human player is required - other players can be human or computer. The 18 computer opponents from the first Hoyle's game return, many of them modeled on other Sierra characters such as Larry Laffer, and again some play 'good' and some play 'evil'.</plot>

    <plot>You are Hugo and you have to save your girlfriend, who had went to babysit a baby in a haunted house. Gameplay is similar to traditional Sierra-style adventures.[CR]Re-released in 1995 commercially as part of the Hugo Trilogy. The trilogy re-release included both the original DOS version and the enhanced Windows version, along with a hint/answer booklet. The Windows version retained the interface of the original DOS version but added a new point-and-click mouse interface, MIDI background music, and digital sound effects. The point scoring system was also modified to increase the total points from 190 in the DOS version to 200 in the Windows version.</plot>

    <plot>I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is a point-and-click adventure game based upon Harlan Ellisons short story of the same title, developed by The Dreamers Guild, co-designed by Ellison and published by Cyberdreams in 1995. The games story is set in a world where an evil computer named AM has destroyed all of humanity except for five people, whom he has been keeping alive and torturing for the past 109 years. Each survivor has a fatal flaw in their character, and in an attempt to crush their spirits, AM has constructed a metaphorical adventure for each that preys upon their weaknesses. To succeed in the game, the player must make choices to prove that humans are better than machines, because they have the ability to redeem themselves. Woven into the fabric of the story are ethical dilemmas dealing with issues such as insanity, rape, paranoia and genocide.</plot>

In 2009, this version was also released as an unlockable extra of the Wii action game Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings, and as a digitally distributed Steam title. The seventh game to use the script language SCUMM, Fate of Atlantis has the player explore environments and interact with objects and characters by using commands constructed with predetermined verbs. It features three unique paths to select, influencing story development, gameplay and puzzles. The game used an updated SCUMM engine and required a 286-based PC, although it still runs as a real-mode DOS application. The CD talkie version required EMS memory enabled to load the voice data.</plot>

    <plot>It is 1938 and adventurer Indiana Jones is joined by his father on this quest, preventing Adolf Hitler from capturing the Holy Grail. He will have to deal with Nazi guards, the Luftwaffe and enemy spies as he tries to stop the tyrannical Nazi leader. The Graphic Adventure uses the same SCUMM gameplay system as the previous Maniac Mansion. Most of the screen is used for a visual rendition of the current scene. At the bottom of the screen are words, which can be clicked on using the mouse to activate their functions. For example, objects can be picked up, used, pushed or pulled, and turned on and off. Most locations are from the movie, but some further scenes are added. In keeping with Indiana's action-man persona, the game also features pure action scenes. Unlike most Lucasfilm adventures, you can die.</plot>

Obviously this is important to farmers, but it is just as important to the boar tribe, for their supply of mud. You'll have to find the Orb and the real thief, to clear your name, save your girlfriend and prevent war with the boar tribe. While your doing this you'll encounter a much larger mystery- What is the origin of the tribes? Legend has it that the humans gave the animals the power of thought and speech, and then vanished.

    <plot>In this game you are Rif, a young fox, who is falsely accused of stealing the magical orb of storms. This orb is capable of predicting when storms will arrive. Obviously this is important to farmers, but it is just as important to the boar tribe, for their supply of mud. You'll have to find the Orb and the real thief, to clear your name, save your girlfriend and prevent war with the boar tribe. While your doing this you'll encounter a much larger mystery- What is the origin of the tribes? Legend has it that the humans gave the animals the power of thought and speech, and then vanished. Who were they and what happened to them?</plot>

    <plot>J.U.L.I.A. is an adventure game about a 35 year old astrobiologist, Rachel Manners. Years ago, telescope Chandra 17 located a solar system very similar to our own, and an artificial signal was picked up from deep within it. A massive space probe was constructed with the goal of meeting and studying extraterrestrial sentient life-forms, and an elite group of scientists was chosen to embark. However, something seems to have gone wrong as Rachel wakes up from a cryogenic sleep, and finds herself alone, orbiting an unknown planet. The rest of the crew is dead, and the probe has been damaged in an impact with a meteoroid swarm. Together with J.U.L.I.A., the space probe’s artificial intelligence, and Mobot, a reconnaissance robot, she starts to explore the solar system.[CR]Gameplay consists of exploring the probe and travelling to six planets to find out what happened to the crew and why the mission failed. Players have to solve puzzles, repair key items and communicate with the artificial intelligence of the ship to progress.</plot>

    <plot>Jones in the Fast Lane is a simulation of a person's life, presented as a turn-based strategy game. You can play by yourself, or compete with other human players or the computer-controlled Jones. At the beginning of the game you determine what your goals are, in four categories - Money, Happiness, Education and Career- the higher your goals, the longer the game. The game itself is presented as something akin to a board game. The board represents the city where you live. Each turn (here, a turn represents a week of your life) you have limited time to act, and you have to choose how to spend it. Walking somewhere else costs you time, as well as working, learning, and looking for a job. The first thing you should do is looking for a job at an employment center. Since initially you have no education, experience or work history, you can only choose the simplest, lowest-paying jobs - such as a janitor or a cook. Later on, as you enroll into various courses at an university, you'll get smart enough to get the high-ranking jobs. But remember that some jobs require you to buy and wear expensive clothes. Work isn't mandatory, and you can dedicate time to working whenever you feel like it. The money you get can be spent in many ways. You can buy a snack at a fast food restaurant (you should eat something each week, or next week you'll have less time due to hunger). You can buy some appliances for your house, lottery tickets, newspapers and more. You can also store your money in the bank (a wise choice, considering the ubiquity of pickpockets) or invest into stock market. Remember that you have to pay rent for your house - if you don't pay for a long time, your landlord will garnish some amount from the money you earn at work. But if you get enough cash, you can rent a luxury apartment and move out of the stinky hole inside which you've been spending your life earlier!</plot>

    <plot>King Graham and Queen Valanice had two children, Alexander and Rosella, and the kingdom was once peaceful. It wasn't long until Alexander was snatched from his crib and things started to take a turn for the worse. A three-headed dragon threatens the ever-peaceful Daventry, and requires a maiden to be sacrificed every year. Rosella is the chosen one. Meanwhile, in a secluded house atop a mountain in the land of Llewdor, the evil wizard called Manannan keeps a young lad named Gwydion as his slave, forcing him to do menial tasks as he prepares his spells and observes the country through his telescope. Gwydion must find a way to outsmart the wizard, escape, and eventually discover the truth about his own identity. King's Quest III- To Heir is Human is an adventure game similar in basic gameplay mechanics to its predecessor The player navigates Gwydion with arrow keys and interacts with the environment by typing verb and noun combination commands. Llewdor consists of interconnected screens that loop once the player character reaches the border of the land. Throughout the course of the game, Gwydion will also travel to other locations and have a magic map at his disposal, allowing him to teleport to different areas. There are more items to collect in this installment, and more complex actions required to execute, raising the difficulty level. A large part of the game proceeds in real time, with Mannanan following his own schedule, forcing the player to plan and time his actions. There is also a time limit imposed on the game's first major quest.</plot>

    <plot>King Graham and Queen Valanice were glad to have their children back. Graham thinks that it is time to pass onto them his old adventurers' hat. When he throws it across the room, he suffers a heart attack and collapses on the floor, and he is carried off to bed. The only way that Graham's health can be restored is by retrieving the magic fruit in the faraway land of Tamir. A beautiful fairy called Genesta offers Rosella the chance to be transported to the land, and find the fruit. But once she gets transported, she cannot be sent back unless she helps the fairy regain her talisman that was stolen by the evil witch, Lolotte. King's Quest IV- The Perils of Rosella is the first game in the series to have a female protagonist. Rosella will meet characters that will either help or hinder her. The player moves Rosella around with arrow keys, and have her perform actions by typing commands. Unlike the previous King's Quest games, which used the AGI engine, this installment uses the new SCI engine with more detailed graphics; the most visible effect is that the game is paused while the player is typing, giving unlimited time to complete even the longest commands. An AGI version of the game, however, was released as well. Gameplay-wise, the game is similar to the first two installments of the series, with a large interconnected world open for exploration and no time limit imposed. The game is the first in the series to have a day and night cycle; certain actions can be performed only during a specific time.</plot>

Its a bitter omen that chills the bones of every man, woman and child in the once peaceful Kingdom of Daventry.

    <plot>For months Prince Alexander of Daventry has shut himself away from the world, thinking only of Princess Cassima, who he met while imprisoned in the previous game. Eventually he can take it no longer, and he hires a ship to search for the Land of the Green Isles located on the edge of the world. After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier. Like its predecessors in the series, King's Quest VI- Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. Alexander must be careful as well, because, as with all the King's Quest games, poor choices or missteps will often prove fatal for the Prince. Puzzles are solved linearly, although late in the game there are two completely different paths to take to reach the final confrontation. Like the previous game, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface with icons that represent verbs (walk, examine, use, talk, etc.).</plot>

    <plot>The name of this entry, The Princeless Bride, is a pun on the title of the novel and film The Princess Bride. Like most Kings Quest titles, it is also a reference to the plot: Princess Rosella is soon to be a bride, but ends up in another world shortly before her marriage. It is the only entry in the series to feature Queen Valanice in a major role, and also the only one in which King Graham is not shown or mentioned at all (with one minor exception in version 1.4).[note 1] Sierra marketed the game as an improvement in the series by stating that completion of earlier KQ adventures was not necessary to fully enjoy the game, even though the final chapter revealed a strong connection to the events of Kings Quest IV.</plot>

    <plot>The Dark Army is on the move again, led by the evil sorceress Scotia. Her goal is obvious: to destroy Gladstone Keep and its ruler King Richard. Scotia herself has recently become more powerful after acquiring "the Mask" from the Urban Mines, gaining the ability to shape-shift. She is virtually unstoppable and able to infiltrate Gladstone Keep, poisoning King Richard. If it were not for the intervention of Sorceress Dawn, the monarch would surely be dead. In order to find a cure for the King's illness, a band of heroes must set out on an adventure, and keep themselves alive from the Dark Army forces.[CR]Lands of Lore: Throne of Chaos is a real-time dungeon-crawling role-playing game viewed from a first-person perspective. Players begin by choosing one of the four available protagonists: the Dracoid Ak'shel (high magic power), the Huline Kieran (high speed), and two humans: Michael (high strength) and Conrad (balanced character). Each has his weaknesses and strengths, but all abilities in the game can be eventually upgraded.[CR]Much of the game consists of exploring pseudo-3D maze-like dungeons.

    <plot>The Dark Army is on the move again, led by the evil sorceress Scotia. Her goal is obvious- to destroy Gladstone Keep and its ruler King Richard. Scotia herself has recently become more powerful after acquiring the Mask from the Urban Mines, gaining the ability to shape-shift. She is virtually unstoppable and able to infiltrate Gladstone Keep, poisoning King Richard. If it were not for the intervention of Sorceress Dawn, this monarch would surely be dead. In order to find a cure for the King's illness, a band of heroes must set out on an adventure, and keep themselves alive from the Dark Army forces. Lands of Lore- Throne of Chaos is a real-time dungeon-crawling role-playing game viewed from first-person perspective. Players begin by choosing one of the four available protagonists- the Dracoid Ak'shel (high magic power), the Huline Kieran (high speed), and two humans- Michael (high strength) and Conrad (balanced character). Each has their weaknesses and strengths, but all abilities in the game can be eventually upgraded. Much of the game consists of exploring pseudo-3D maze-like dungeons. Most of them contain secret areas and it is sometimes necessary to solve puzzle to advance. Real-time combat involves clicking on either attack or magic icon for each character. Depending on their speed attribute they will need a certain amount of cooldown time before the player can activate them again. Point-and-click interface allows interaction with some background objects, sometimes eliciting comments from the protagonist or his companions. The game does not feature manual character development, introducing instead a semi-automatic form of leveling up, where skills of the hero and the companions are divided into Fighting, Magic and Rogue skills.

    <plot>One year after the events described in The Colonel's Bequest, Laura Bow, fresh out of college, is hired by a New York newspaper to write a story about the newest exhibit acquired by the local Leyendecker Museum, an ancient Egyptian dagger. However, during a party to celebrate the opening of the museum's new section, someone is murdered, the dagger is stolen, and Laura, after asking to be allowed to investigate, is locked in with the rest of the guests. This sets the stage for a series of murders, and it is up to Laura to find the person responsible for them. The Dagger of Amon Ra plays similarly to the The Colonel's Bequest, focusing primarily on exploration and clue-gathering rather than on solving puzzles, although there are more instances of inventory item collection and usage in the sequel. With the exception of the introductory act, the entire game is set in the museum. The player navigates Laura through its rooms and interacts with characters to gather information and uncover their true motives. The game's clock advances when it is triggered by certain actions or simply by moving from location to location. Some information and events may only be available in specific places and at specific times. Near the end of the game Laura will be asked to make a case to to the coroner, which involves answering a series of questions concerning the crimes. Depending on his playing style, clues discovered, and deductive skills, the player may or may not have the correct answers to all the questions. Unlike its predecessor - and like most other contemporary Sierra adventures - the game utilizes an icon-based interface instead of typing verb-object commands to interact with the environments. Topics can also be chosen from a list when the player selects the Ask command. The CD version features full speech, including narration.</plot>

    <plot>Almost twenty years passed since the inhabitants of Earth defeated the Leather Goddesses of Phobos. The year now is 1958, and the scientific world is excited at the news of the discovery of a new planet in the Solar System, a so-called Planet X. One night, a spaceship crash-lands in the small town of Atom City, Nevada, home to a military base and a nuclear power plant. The alien Barth, a self-described Pulsating Inconvenience from Planet X, brings terrible news to the people of Earth- the Goddesses have conquered Planet X and forced its denizens to become sex slaves. Gas Pump Girls is the sequel to Leather Goddesses of Phobos. The player can choose between three different protagonists- the alien Barth, the gas station owner Zeke, or Lydia, the daughter of the astronomer who discovered Planet X. Barth's scenario involves different tasks, while the humans' gameplay is largely identical, with the exception of different dialogues. Unlike the previous game, the sequel is a graphical adventure without any text input. The player interacts with the environment in a point-and-click fashion, with a smart cursor that automatically changes its shape depending on the possible action that can be executed with a person or an object. The game has multiple-choice conversations, many of which are optional.</plot>

    <plot>Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (In Several Wrong Places) is the second game in Al Lowes Leisure Suit Larry series. Continuing the plot of the previous game, the swinging single Larry Laffer has finally found his true love and is happily living with her. Right? Wrong!.. Because Larry is mercilessly thrown out by his great love and is left all alone, penniless, and womanless, in Los Angeles. Accidentally, Larry comes into contact with KGB agents who will pursue him all over the globe from now on. And there is also the evil doctor Noontonyt plotting evil schemes on a remote tropical island... Looks like Larry will have to forget about his women-related problems for now... or is it so?[CR]The second game in the series introduces an improved engine (allowing for full-screen graphics and mouse control for movement). As opposed to the first game, which relied on exploration of one large area, the sequel has a more linear progression, the player being continuously taken to new locations as dictated by the plot. There are less puzzles in this installment than in the previous game; however, the number of ways to die has increased, danger awaiting Larry in most places he visits.</plot>

    <plot>Shape Up or Slip Out! is the fifth game in Al Lowes Leisure Suit Larry series. All the events from the previous games are forgotten. Larry is once again single, and again his goal is to capture the interest of various ladies. By sheer coincidence, Larry finds himself on a TV Game Show called Stallions. He wins a weekend at the Spa Resort, La Costa Lotta. Naturally, there are some beautiful women in the spa who are just dreaming about such a wonderful, handsome man as Larry! Uh... or is it really so? It is the players goal to find out![CR]This instalment focuses more on conversations with women and puzzles than on the storyline. The entire game is spent at La Costa Lotta. There are plenty of traditional inventory-based puzzles to solve in the game. Larry can die, but the player is allowed to try again every time that happens, without the need to restore a saved game. This is also the first Larry game with SVGA graphics, and voice-overs in the CD version.</plot>

    <plot>Leisure Suit Larry 6: Shape Up or Slip Out! is the fifth entry in the Leisure Suit Larry series of graphical adventure games published by Sierra On-Line. Originally developed for DOS, a remake was produced in CD-ROM format a year after its release. The enhanced version of the game offers revamped graphics in SVGA resolution and voice acting, a first for the series. Both versions use an icon interface similar to other Sierra games of the time, but unlike most Sierra games, the icon bar is visible at all times.</plot>

    <plot>Leisure Suit Larry 1- In the Land of the Lounge Lizards is a remake of the first game in the Leisure Suit Larry series. It introduces a new interface. Instead of typing commands, the player performs the desired actions by choosing appropriate icons, and then clicking on objects on the screen to interact with them. The graphics are now 256 color VGA. There is also much more music than in the original version, and it supports more advanced sound formats.</plot>

    <plot>Larry Laffer is a short, tacky, balding, forty-year-old man who has been living with his mother until recently. He used to be in the software business, but decided to leave everything behind as he moved to the city of Lost Wages in pursuit of sexual fulfillment. Clad in a white polyester leisure suit, Larry finds himself outside of Lefty's Bar, determined to finally lose his virginity - or commit suicide if he is unable to achieve that goal before dawn. Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure, though with a greatly enhanced script containing more humorous descriptions and dialogue. The gameplay is similar to other third-person Sierra adventures- a text parser is used to input commands for interaction with a graphical environment. Progress is achieved by collecting various items and figuring out which of those may be essential for conquering the hearts of the several female characters appearing in the game. The game allows the player to access most of its locations (a bar, a casino, a convenience store, etc.) from the very beginning, with only a few key ones being barred due to the lack of a crucial item. Moving between some of the locations can only be done by cab. Paying for those trips, as well as procuring some of the items, requires the player to manage Larry's finance by gambling at the casino. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions. There are several ways to die in the game, most presented in a humorous fashion. The game contains adult situations and semi-implicit depictions of sex.</plot>

    <plot>The Farm allows kids 3-8 (or any age) to explore the idyllic farm, as depicted in movies - orchards, horse, gardens, cows, chickens, waterwheel, fields, a pond - it's all here. Kids learn about the operation of a farm in over 40 different locations around the farm, with their guide Buzzy The Knowledge Bug. Go inside the red barn and milk a cow, or check out the growing vegetables in the garden, watch the waterwheel grind away, or peek inside the chicken coop. Items in each location can be clicked on for either amusing animations, or to ask What is This? which will take them directly to the encyclopedia page describing that item. The encyclopedia has more than 200 descriptions in it. It also has an index, to jump directly back to interesting items, and the pictures in the index take you to a spot in the farm that the item can be found. The encyclopedia is text, but Buzzy can also read the text for young players. In addition, the game has 5 Time To Play mini-games. The Coloring Book has 15 different pictures to color and print out. Trivia contains 100 farm-related questions with answers within the game - for pre-readers, Buzzy will read the question out loud and also provide hints. There are 3 difficulty levels for this game. In Eggs Away, you have to catch the eggs that the chickens lay before they hit the ground - catch enough and you move onto the next level. But you have to watch out for the rats. There's also the Find It game, where the game randomly picks 10 items (out of 110 possible) within the game and you go find them around the farm. This game has 3 difficulty levels. Finally, there's Spell It. This spelling game has three difficulty levels - at the easiest level you just add a single missing letter to a word (there's a picture of the farm-related item); at the medium level you have to figure out the word based on a picture; at the hardest level there's no picture. The on-screen cows indicate your progress in the harder levels. .</plot>

    <plot>This game allows children to explore Humongous versions of the South American, African and Southeast Asian jungles, and learn about some of the animal and plant life there. Like The Airport and The Farm titles, this game features Buzzy the Knowledge Bug as a guide. He reads aloud questions, answers, and the names of objects. In addition, he provides tips and suggestions and points out interesting facts. Kids can explore the three environments, each of which has quite a few locations, where they can click on things for fun animations or instead ask What Is This? and go to a micro-encyclopedia for each item which describes the item and shows where they are from. The 210-item encyclopedia also has an index, so kids can jump right to items - clicking on the picture on the page will take you a place where that bug, bird, plant, or animal can be found. The encyclopedia has text, but will also read to the child if they wish - you can have it read each word by just holding the cursor over the word too. The pages also have colored hyper-linked words that are topics of other pages in the encyclopedia. The game also has 5 mini-games, such as Trivia or Find It (shown game-related images and then have to go find them), or a 15-page coloring book (which can be printed out and has mixable colors) and Jungle Jumble (spelling/unscramble game). The Anteater Feeder mini-game is just for fun, an 100-level arcade version of the old carnival shooting game except the weapon is an anteater's tongue and you eat bugs. These games have difficulty settings, to make things harder or easier.</plot>

Near the cottage is a lighthouse, inhabited by the eccentric Dr. Jeremiah Krick and his daughter Amanda. One day, glancing out of the window, the hero(ine) notices that the lighthouse has been struck by lightning. Dr. Krick has also left an unclear message on the answering machine, imploring the protagonist to come as soon as possible. Upon arriving at the lighthouse, the protagonist finds out that its inhabitants have been kidnapped by a mysterious being, and transported into a parallel universe. A strange new world must be explored, and its mysteries solved, in order to bring back Dr. Krick and his daughter[CR]Lighthouse: The Dark Being is a first-person adventure game conceived in the vein of Myst. Locations are represented as pre-rendered still screens. Interaction with the environment is performed with a simple single-cursor, point-and-click interface. Similarly to Myst, the puzzles are notable for their difficulty, and are logic- rather than inventory-based, consisting of careful observation, clue-gathering, and manipulation of the environments.</plot>

    <plot>Based on Aesop’s tale of determination and perseverance, Living Books brings the story of The Tortoise and the Hare. Who hasn’t heard the story about the slow tortoise that, in the end, wins the race against the speedy hare? The story is presented across a baker's dozen of screens. Each starts with simple narration which allows and encourages reading along. Then the user can interact with many items on each page for exploration and fun. In theme with other Living Books series, the title presents pages that are drawn in a brightly colored cartoon style. Many hidden objects within the pages are waiting to be found by clicking on them to start a fun animation sequence. You can also click on any of the words of the story and hear them repeated to promote reading skills.</plot>

    <plot>Arthur is excited about a brand new computer game called Deep Dark Sea. Specifically, the goal of the game is to find the thing, which if done, he'll win the prizes. Eager to do this, he spends all the time he can, but doesn't actually make it before bed-time. The next morning, Arthur invites Buster over, but can't use the computer since Mrs. Read is working on it. She tells them to stay off of it after taking a trip to her office, but they're both too anxious and choose to play the game anyway. They come across a treasure chest, and find out it's the thing they were looking for. They jump for the computer fighting over the mouse, and accidentally knock the keyboard off the desk, and the screen goes blank. Since turning the computer off and on again didn't solve the problem, they run through the manuals looking for a solution, and then decide to look for the Brain thinking he will know the solution. After searching for a long time, they finally see him at the pond, but he turns out to be no help either. As a last resort they go to the computer store asking for a solution. He explains his problem to the computer expert but the computer expert says that the fees for fixing are too high. Arthur then says that it would be more birthday money than he ever would see in his whole life. Mrs. Read comes home before they can fix it as a result, and Arthur is too nervous to talk to her. He desperately tries to keep her away from the computer, but Arthur is eventually forced to admit his mistake. Arthur asks if he is going to get punished and Mrs. Reed says Of course. You did something you weren't supposed to do. D.W. tells Mrs. Reed to make the punishment really good. Mrs. Read tells him he's being grounded from the computer for one whole week, but instead of getting back to her work, she decides to try the game out. When Arthur and D.W. are already for bed, she decided to play Arthur's Game- Deep Dark Sea.</plot>

    <plot>Green Eggs and Ham is the second Dr. Seuss Living Book Adaptation from Broderbund. The story features Sam-I-Am, who repeatedly asks the questions based on an object, e.g. “Would you Could you on a boat?”. This leads to his grumpy friend saying “I do not like Green Eggs an Ham”. The story gets more dramatic as it progresses. There are some activities featuring characters from the story like the Fox in a Box, and the Mouse in the House. The game features word recognition, vocabulary, reading comprehension and computer literacy. Every page is clickable for a few surprises. In Read to Me, the program automatically turns the pages leaving out the games as the story progresses.</plot>

Watch and listen as he tells the story of The Little Samurai, an adaptation of the traditonal Japanese folk tale, Little One Inch. This story about a tiny boy named Taro and his quest to become a brave samurai captures the magic and culture of life in Japan while teaching life lessons that chidren everywhere can share. Little Taro is a clever, kind, and very brave boy who is only one inch tall! To prove his bravery, Taro decides to become a samurai warrior. One day, he sets out on a dangerous journey through the wilderness to reach the Emperors palace. When he arrives, the Emperor is impressed with the boys courage. He grants Taro the honour of becoming the samurai guard of the princess. Soon after accepting this special mission, Taro proves his worthiness by protecting princess Aya from a fierce ogre. Instead of fighting the ogre, however, Taro tickles him! The ogre is humiliated and runs off in disgrace, leaving behind his magic scepter. To show her gratitude, Aya wishes upon the scepter for Taro to become as tall as he is brave. Her wish granted, Princess Aya and Taro live happily ever after and leave us with the lesson that laughter is mightier than the sword. With the help of fun characters and original music and songs, this action-packed, animated story unfolds before your eyes. You and your child will delight in finding the hundred of animations, sounds, and other surprises waiting for you in The Little Samurai.</plot>

    <plot>The Earth has been invaded by the Orb Alliance, and a tightly restricted regime instituted for the humans that remain. Brown monk robes are the only garments allowed, speaking is a capital offense, and every human has been implanted with a tracking chip recording their every move. To track down criminals, the Orbs enlist Manhunters - humans given access to advanced technology and selected to be a combination of police officers and bounty hunters. The player controls one such Manhunter as he unravels a conspiracy inside the decaying heart of the New York ruins, and a mysterious serial killer on the loose. Each chapter begins with the Orbs assigning the player's nameless Manhunter with a crime (such as murder) or target to investigate. The player gains leads through the use of the MAD computer, which displays the logs of all civilian movement in an area in an overhead map view. By starting with the victim and following the people who encountered him that day, the player can then go to a first-person investigation view at various New York landmarks to find clues to the suspect's identity. At the end of the day, the player must report the correct name of their suspect to the Orbs. Manhunter uses a modified version of Sierra's AGI interpreter, with a rudimentary point-and-click interface used to locate and uncover clues at the investigation sites. At various times throughout the investigation, the player will also have to directly control the Manhunter in arcade-style challenges, like dodging gang attacks or throwing knives between a bar patron's fingers.</plot>

    <plot>Picking up immediately where Manhunter- New York left off, Manhunter 2- San Francisco has the player crash-landing their stolen ship in the City by the Bay after trying unsuccessfully to keep up with enigmatic serial killer Phil. Left with no alternatives, the player assumes the identity of a local Manhunter and solves more crimes for the alien Orbs while searching for Phil and working for the local human resistance. Manhunter 2 presents the same urban decay and oppressive alien invader regime as visualized in the original, this time using streets and landmarks from the Bay Area. The Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower, Alcatraz prison, and the TransAmerica Pyramid all receive alien makeovers. New puzzles, new characters, and new investigations await as the player tracks Phil by his string of strangled corpses. All concepts and gameplay elements from Manhunter- New York return. The player again uses the MAD tracking device to follow suspects provided by the alien Orbs and uses clues found through first-person location investigation to discover the suspects' name. Occasional arcade sequences bring mixed challenges, and though they cannot be skipped, a new difficulty option has been implemented. The same point-and-click gameplay (no typing required) is used to navigate the game world.</plot>

    <plot>Seventeen years after the initial release of the classic LucasArts adventure Maniac Mansion, the game has been revamped for modern systems in a 256-colour freeware remake by fans. Aside from the crisp graphics, they improved the SCUMM-interface itself and it now features digital sound effects and continuous background music, designed with the Adventure Game Studio engine. Although it is a complete remake built from scratch, the designers kept the gameplay, story and the many gags from the original game intact.</plot>

    <plot>Martian Memorandum is the sequel to Mean Streets. Six years have found the private investigator Tex Murphy broke, down on his luck, and seriously in need of a new case. He gets a call from Marshall Alexander, a business tycoon who owns most of the industry on Mars. It seems his daughter Alexis has run away from home, and taken "something else" with her. Marshall won't say what that something else is, but he is willing to pay handsomely to get it (and his daughter) back.[CR]Unlike its predecessor, the game contains only adventure gameplay, removing flight simulation and action sequences. Basic gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the first game, placing interrogation and choices above object-based puzzles. Verb commands are used to interact with the environment, while interrogating suspects usually involves selecting conversation options. Making a wrong choice may sometimes prematurely end the game or render it unwinnable.</plot>

    <plot>This is an updated version of Roberta Williams' Mixed-Up Mother Goose. This version utilizes Sierra's SCI game interpreter and features enhanced graphics and sound. The gameplay remains the same as the previous version; all of the nursery rhymes in Mother Goose Land have become mixed up! Your goal is to set things straight by locating missing items for each of the fairy tale characters in the land. When wandering around the land you can talk to the different characters (each from a different nursery rhyme) to find out what item it is they need; for example, Little Bo Peep is looking for her sheep and Jack Be Nimble lost his candle stick. The items are scattered about the land, and when you locate one pick it up and return it to the appropriate character. When successful, the complete nursery rhyme will play with the lyrics appearing on screen. You can only carry one item at a time, so you may need to remember where you spotted or dropped items not being carried! Also, each time the game is played objects will be in a new location. Included with the game is a map of Mother Goose Land which may help you locate the different fairy tale characters.</plot>

    <plot>Nippon Safes, Inc. is the predecessor to Big Red Adventure, both being cartoon adventure games by Italian developer Dynabyte. As in its followup, here players take the role of three different heroes (though, opposite to Goblins series, one at time). They are Doug, the smart safe cracker; Dino, the strong, but dumb, boxer; and Donna, the sexy club dancer. [CR]The game takes place in Tokyo. While all three characters explore almost the same areas, each of the heroes has its own story to follow and puzzles to solve. You can choose which character would you like to play first, and which - lastly. When you have finished all three sub-plots, you'll get a final with all three characters acting altogether.[CR]The game features cartoonish, comics-style graphics, unique icon-based interface and non-linear plot. It is also full of Italian humor, and the game is played more like a comedy, rather then crime-based adventure.</plot>

So his next genius plan is to use the inhabitants of the planet Earth, known as "humans", as a raw, protein-rich material for the tasty burgers. However, interstellar law forbids using sentient creatures as meat. Every raw ingredient has to pass specific tests for sentience. Zlarg knows it, and he rigs the tests in such a way that no creature can pass it. Enter Wilbur Wafflemeier, an ordinary guy who is about to be grilled... in more than one way. Somehow, the unlikely hero has to find a way to pass the tests...[CR]Orion Burger is a traditional puzzle-solving adventure with cartoon-like 2D graphics. It uses verb commands "Take", "Use", and "Talk" for interaction with the environment. The game consists of five tests, each of them requiring Wilbur to explore his home town, talk to people, gather inventory items, and solve tricky puzzles in order to succeed and qualify as a sentient being.</plot>

Journeying into his closet with his purple Pajama Sam mask, Signature-Edition, All-Metal Pajama Man Lunch Box (often known as the Portable Bad Guy Containment Unit), and his Illuminator Mark 5 Jr. Flashlight, Sam tumbles down into the Land of Darkness and is soon stopped by a group of trees acting as customs. After freeing himself, Sam goes on an adventure to reclaim his lost equipment. He befriends a boat named Otto and a mine cart named King, who help Sam throughout his exciting search. After a quest spanning a river, a lava-filled mine, and Darknesss house, Sam goes to confront Darkness.</plot>

    <plot>A writer named Adrienne Delaney has just moved into an old mansion with her photographer husband Donald. Shortly after moving in, Adrienne begins to experience horrifying nightmares and have odd encounters inside the creepy old abode. Furthermore, the house is having a severe effect on her husband, changing him for the worse. Adrienne must discover the secret of the house before the unknown force consumes her husband, and unravel the terrible events that have happened in the past.[CR]Phantasmagoria is an adventure game that places heavy emphasis on full motion video for exposition and cutscenes at various junctures to advance the storyline. Adrienne is represented as a digitized character roaming around pre-rendered settings in the house. She inspects various rooms, finds items, adds them to her inventory, finds places to use the items, and triggers advancements in the plot. [CR]Puzzle-solving element is present, though reduced compared to most other adventure games made by Sierra. There are seven chapters in the game, as well as a status screen that tracks the players progress within the chapter. If the player happens to get stuck in the game, a talking skull icon who identifies himself as the hintkeeper can supply the player with hints on request. It is possible to start playing the game from any chapter.</plot>

    <plot>Curtis Craig is a thirty-year-old man whose distorted childhood is filled with horrors. His father was involved in an illegal, top-secret experiment for a company called WynTech Industries. Nearly nothing is known about the true nature of this experiment; but something in it affected the sanity of Curtis' mother, eventually driving her to suicide. Curtis' father was later shot, leaving the poor little boy with serious behavioural disturbances, and eventually in therapy.[CR]Now, a year after having been released from the mental institution, Curtis is employed at WynTech Industries, whose manager, Paul Warner, has seemingly taken it upon himself to take care of Curtis. He tries to find the cause of his psychotic episodes and the mysterious murders that break out all around him, all the while discovering more and more about his past life and his father's fate.[CR]Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh is not an actual sequel to the original Phantasmagoria, but rather a follow-up that has similar themes and visual concept. The game is more heavy on puzzles and traditional adventure gameplay than its predecessor. The gameplay involves standard activities found in adventure games, including extended conversations with the characters featuring selectable dialogue topics, collecting and manipulating inventory items with the environment, etc. It is possible (and often necessary) to call characters on the phone, as well as check and answer e-mails accessed by Curtis' computer at his workplace.[CR]Like its predecessor, the game has a simple point-and-click interface and employs video sequences with live actors as cutscenes. Short movies are usually shown after each action performed by the protagonist.</plot>

    <plot>The narrator introduces his friend, Ben, who lives with his Uncle Archibald, who owns a shop. In Archibalds past, he wrote stories about witches, wizards, and monsters. He kept a description of each monster on his computer, which Ben and the narrator, peep at. One monster particularly catches their eye: Ogre Kringle, who eats kids with chocolate sauce.[CR]Later Ben and the narrator are looking for an unnamed secret formula, when they add the contents of a little green bottle and there is an explosion. A dense fog moves through the house, and the lights go out. Going to the kitchen, looking for candles, the pair discover a monster looking through the refrigerator, complaining that he was unable to find any chocolate sauce! The pair manage to neutralise Ogre Kringle before he can find the sauce and eat them.[CR]Fearing more of the monsters from the stories, they call Uncle Archibald and tell him everything. There is a loud footstep, and the pair take refuge in the living room. When the lights come on, all the monsters are there laughing at them. Fatso, a large brown monster, grabs them as Uncle Archibald storms in. The monsters, fearing the wrath of their creator, let the two friends go.[CR]Archibald threatens the monsters; that if they did not go back to the stories then he would send them to a soppy love story. The ashamed monsters vanish.[CR]Archibald explains that the little green bottle contained a spell that materialized things that we imagine.[CR]Plus, other stories include The Big Brag, The Bippolo Seed, Horton Hatches the Egg, The Sneetches, In the Night Kitchen and The Munkits.</plot>

    <plot>Little time has passed since the events of Police Quest, when Sonny Bonds climbed the ranks of the Lytton police department and became the key element in the arrest of Jesse Bains, the notorious drug lord. After the trial, Sonny's application to the Homicide division was accepted and proposed to Marie, who had her prostitution charges dropped and started a new life away from the streets. Life was good - until Bains escaped, taking advantage of a low-security prison and an inexperienced correctional officer. Sonny is now in danger from a vengeful Bains and is saddled with his new chain-smoker partner Keith. Sonny goes to the field again to capture Bains, but things are about to get awfully personal... Using Sierra's new SCI engine, the graphics are more vibrant than in the first game, but gameplay remains basically the same, with the player ordering Sonny to move to a place in the scene (either using the directional keys or the new mouse interface) and a parser interface to interact with the game world. Game sequences are more varied, and include a shooting range, an underwater search or searching the inside of an escape vehicle. The driving sequences are gone, and the player can relax while reading the chatter between Sonny and Keith as they move from location to location. The approach to the game, however, is radically different. While the first (for a large part) is based on street police work, this sequel is oriented into forensics field work such as collecting evidences that link Bains into the happenings of the game.</plot>

    <plot>Sonny Bonds, the sergeant of Lytton police department, thought he could finally enjoy peaceful life with his wife Marie after the drug lord Jessie Bains has been put away for good. However, a series of gruesome murders perpetrated by a sinister cult known as The Kindred shocks the city. Marie becomes a victim of their attack and falls into a coma. It becomes Sonny's very personal mission to track down the attackers and make them pay for their crimes. The Kindred is the third installment of the Police Quest series, its events taking place after those described in The Vengeance. The game brings back some of the elements of the first game, such as a modified version of driving sequences and police procedures unrelated to the main plot the protagonist must go through. Computer work is particularly emphasized, requiring the player to perform tasks such as using facial composite software or figuring out murder patterns by studying a map. Like other Sierra adventures of the time, the game uses an icon-based interface for interaction with the environment.</plot>

    <plot>Police Quest: Open Season is the fourth installment in the Police Quest series. It abandons the story arc of the previous three games, introducing a new setting and a new protagonist, homicide detective John Carey of the Los Angeles Police Department. Carey finds his best friend and ex-partner, Officer Bob Hickman, murdered in an alley in the Southern part of the city. An eight-year-old boy named Bobby Washington has been murdered as well. Carey begins an investigation that leads him deep into the criminal life of the city and a hunt for a maniacal murderer.[CR]The game utilizes Sierras traditional icon-based interface for interaction with the environment and generally follows an adventure format. However, it focuses on realistic police procedures even more than the previous games in the series. Much of the gameplay is dedicated to examining crime scenes, questioning suspects, and conducting a by-the-book investigation. There is a considerable degree of freedom in the interaction, allowing the player to perform actions not connected to the main story, some of which will, however, lead to the protagonists death. The game utilizes digitized photorealistic images for its visuals.</plot>

    <plot>Police Quest and SWAT are a series of police simulation video games produced and published by Sierra On-Line between 1987 and 1998. The first five games were adventure game/simulations, the first three of which were designed by former policeman Jim Walls. The fourth and later titles were designed by former LAPD Chief Daryl F. Gates. Both SWAT and the real-time strategy game SWAT 2 still carried the Police Quest name and were numbered V and VI in the series, respectively, although subsequent titles in the series would drop the Police Quest title altogether.</plot>

    <plot>Quest for Glory I: So You Want To Be A Hero is a remake of Heros Quest: So You Want To Be A Hero.[CR]The remake features 256-color VGA graphics. Locations have been re-drawn, and character portraits appear during conversations. This version also has an icon-based interface instead of the text input of the original, very similar to the one used by Sierra for their adventure titles. The player selects dialogue choices from a dialogue menu, as opposed to typing in conversation topics in the earlier release. A few changes have been made to the dialogue, adding (or altering) some of the easter eggs and references to other games.[CR]Combat now features clay models for the enemies and stop-motion animation. The perspective has been switched to an over-the-shoulder view farther away from the player. Battle commands (two types of attacks, parry, and dodge) are displayed as icons on a shield in the corner of the screen. The player can switch to the spell menu at any time, and also click the middle of the screen to escape from combat.</plot>

    <plot>Quest for Glory II- Trial by Fire is a remake of the earlier game game of the same name. It features 256-color VGA graphics (as opposed to the original's 16-color EGA) and an icon-based interface very similar to that of the third game. All the original locations, dialogues, and gameplay elements have been preserved. Though the interface is mouse-based, the player still has the options of choosing topics during conversations by typing them, along with selecting them from a menu. The remake features additional dialogue options and easter eggs connected to subsequent installments of the series. There is also an option to simplify the maze-like layout of the town Shapeir; the street names in the town are displayed when highlighted, allowing easier navigation. Combat preserves the available commands of the original version, adding the possibility of advancing and retreating on the battle screens. Another new feature is the option to set battles on auto, customizing the hero's actions.</plot>

    <plot>Wages of War is the third game in the Quest for Glory series. It is set in the Africa-like world of Tarna, where the hero travels with paladin Rakeesh, his new Liontaur friend he has met in the previous game. Shortly after his arrival, the hero learns about the conflict between the human Simbani tribe and the seemingly malevolent neighboring Leopardmen. It is now time for our hero to become a skillful diplomat and prevent an upcoming war between the two nations. The basic gameplay system is similar to that of the two preceding games. The game has an adventure-like structure and gameplay elements, including puzzles to solve, inventory items to use, and characters to talk to, as well as a role-playing system with combat and character development. As in the predecessors, the player character can be either a fighter, a thief, or a mage; in this installment, the paladin class is selectable from the beginning of the game (unlike the previous game, where the hero could only earn the title of a paladin during the course of the story). Saved characters from the previous game can be imported. Like in the earlier Quest for Glory games, the main character's parameters increase directly after battles or by repeatedly performing various actions. New to the series is an overworld map on which the hero travels between locations. Hostile encounters may occur randomly while traversing the map. Combat system is similar to the predecessors, with real-time battles where the player selects various offensive and defensive options. Graphics engine and interface in this installment are the same as in the remake of the first game- it has 256-color graphics and an icon-based interface which was used by Sierra for their contemporary adventure games.</plot>

    <plot>Nobody has expected it - but one day, something entered the solar system from outside. The mysterious object appeared to be a gigantic cylinder with unknown properties. The International Space Agency (ISA) sent the special Newton Team onto the object, which they dubbed "Rama". The scientists soon discovered that Rama was, in fact, a huge biomechanical collector of alien species and their cities. One of the explorers, Valeriy Borzov, dies under mysterious circumstances. Another astronaut is sent to replace him, investigate the circumstances that led to his death, and perhaps uncover the mystery of Rama.[CR]Rama is a puzzle-solving adventure game based on Arthur C. Clarke's series of science fiction novels. Visually and gameplay-wise, it mostly follows the template of Myst, consisting of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action scenes, and focusing almost entirely on complex logic puzzles. The player character has a special device called "wristcomp", which includes communicative, automapping, and teleporting abilities. A personal android provides descriptions of objects and comments on the events of the game.</plot>

    <plot>It is the present time (1993), and many people are about to enjoy the performance of the opera "Don Juan Triumphant" at the Palais Garnier. However, that piece of art will soon become covered with the blood of innocents, as the great ceiling chandelier crushes down on the crowd.[CR]The player controls Raoul Montand, a detective who's been asked for help by his old friend Monsieur Brie, the manager of the Opera. Bringing Raoul to a crime scene, he leaves him in hope he'll find some clues and prevent this terror from happening again. Supposedly, the disaster was caused by a being known as the Phantom of the Opera, a mysterious creature who has been haunting the opera house since 1881. The detective is about to find out what secrets lie beneath the surface, looking for clues in the present time and traveling back to 1881.[CR]Return of the Phantom is a third-person adventure game based on the book Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux. The player interacts with the environment by selecting verb commands (Look, Talk, Take, Push, etc.) from a menu and combining them with objects to gather information, solve puzzles, and advance the story. Most of the events in the game take place inside the opera house, including the numerous tunnels and secret passages beneath it, which are supposedly the Phantom's residence. The CD version of the game adds voice-overs to the dialogues.</plot>

    <plot>After the Stranger has rescued Atrus, the master of linking books, from the imprisonment caused by his sons, a new task awaits the hero. Atrus's wife, Catherine, has been taken by Gehn, his own father. Gehn has appointed himself as the one to rule the Age of Riven, and has driven his world to collapse. Now he holds Catherine hostage on Riven, hoping that his son will restore the book link to the Age and free him from there. The Stranger is requested by Atrus to travel to Riven and find a way to rescue Catherine.[CR]Riven is a sequel to Myst, and is very similar to its predecessor in gameplay style, controls, and visual presentation. The game world is presented as a series of computer-generated still screens; the player explores it in a point-and-click fashion. Interaction with the environment is possible only when said environment is highlighted as a "hot spot", and is also performed by simple clicking. Like its predecessor, Riven is heavy on puzzles, which rarely include using inventory items, but usually involve understanding and manipulating the complex environments and machinery of the game world.</plot>

    <plot>Rosemary is a short point-and-click adventure centered around the theme of childhood memories. When Rosemary discovers a photograph of a forgotten friend, she cannot recall what has become of him, so she decides to travel back to the town of New Rye to find out if it brings back any memories. At the start of the game three locations are available that the girl can explore freely. To progress in the game and solve the mystery, Rosemary's memory needs to be pieced back together. By examining the environment she will recall certain events that are stored as photographs. Placing these correctly inside a diary completes lines of text, reveals additional information and changes the environment, sometimes introducing new object or other subtle changes.</plot>

Although there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles, the player can work on multiple tasks at once, and exploration occupies a large portion of the game.

The game frequently parodies popular fairy tales and fantasy works and sometimes breaks the fourth wall as Simon directly talks to the player, acknowledging he is a character in a computer game.</plot>

    <plot>Simon is just an ordinary boy living in modern-day England. One day, his dog Chippy discovers a chest with a book inside, entitled Ye Olde Spellbooke. Without thinking too much, Simon throws the book on the floor; as a result, a portal opens, teleporting the boy and his dog into a fantasy world. Simon is promptly captured by goblins bent on cooking and eating him, but manages to escape. Soon he realizes that he must play the role of an apprentice sorcerer and rescue a benevolent wizard called Calypso from an evil one, aptly named Sordid.Simon the Sorcerer is a point-and-click adventure game very similar to contemporary LucasArts titles (in particular Monkey Island) in concept and gameplay. It features twelve verbs displayed on the screen at all times for interaction with the environment. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player hovers the mouse cursor over them. The puzzles are inventory-based: Simon will have to collect and carry a large amount of items in order to advance in the game. Almost every character comes with an extended dialogue tree to explore. Most of the conversation choices are used for a humorous effect and are not required to pursue. Like in LucasArts' adventures, it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck or die in Simon the Sorcerer. The game world consists of dozens of interconnected screens, most of which are accessible from the very beginning. Although there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles, the player can work on multiple tasks at once, and exploration occupies a large portion of the game. Whenever an important location is discovered, it is marked on the map for instant access, so that the player is not required to retrace his steps in order to revisit it. The game frequently parodies popular fairy tales and fantasy works and sometimes breaks the fourth wall as Simon directly talks to the player, acknowledging he is a character in a computer game.</plot>

Together, they visit various locations and undertake various tasks toward the end of enjoying a camping trip in the great outdoors together.[CR]The game is presented as a series of static images, described in text at the bottom of the screen -- then optionally narrated for children whose reading skills arent yet up to keeping up with the plot. After each description has been read, the illustrations can be interacted with like a pop-up book, numerous hidden hot spots on every page yielding zany + whimsical animations.</plot>

    <plot>Space Quest 1- Roger Wilco in the Sarien Encounter is a remake of the original release of Space Quest- Chapter I - The Sarien Encounter. The new version has enhanced graphics (256 color VGA) and soundblaster support. It uses the SCI game engine (point-and-click interface, icons along the top) rather than the AGI engine (mixed point-and-click with text parser). Some of the puzzles have been slightly changed to accommodate the new interface and it is also possible to skip the arcade part. There are a few additional scenes and more elaborate text descriptions, mostly enhancing the humorous effect.</plot>

    <plot>Roger Wilco is one of the most important men on the starship Arcada- he is the janitor! Just when he was doing what he does best (dozing off in a closet), the shrill sound of an alarm penetrated the air. Arcada is attacked by the evil Sariens! Before Roger realizes what is going on, he discovers that he is the only survivor. The Sariens have killed the entire crew and stolen the valuable Star Generator. Roger's immediate task is to find a way to leave Arcada, which is about to explode in fifteen minutes. And then he'll have to show the Sariens why they should never mess with brave intergalactic janitors! Space Quest- The Sarien Encounter is a humorous sci-fi adventure game made with Sierra's AGI engine. The gameplay is similar to that of King's Quest- the player navigates Roger around with arrow keys and interacts with the game world by typing commands. There are puzzles to solve and plenty of situations where the player will have to use his wit to save Roger from death.</plot>

    <plot>The ace janitor Roger Wilco thought he'd seen the last of Sludge Vohaul. However, like every evil scientist is supposed to, Vohaul returns with an even meaner scheme. This time he intends to infest the planet Xenon with thousands of genetically engineered door-to-door life insurance salesmen. The last thing he wants is Roger messing things up, and so the brave janitor is captured and brought to the planet Labion to spend the rest of his days working in Vohaul's mines. Fortunately, the shuttle that takes him to the mines crashes, and Roger is the only survivor. He will have to survive the dangers of the jungle planet Labion, and eventually stop Vohaul from executing his mad plan. Vohaul's Revenge is the sequel to The Sarien Encounter, and the second game in Sierra's humorous Space Quest series of adventure games. The player navigates Roger Wilco around with arrow keys, and interacts with the world by typing commands. Like in the previous game, there are many ways for the player character to die. Much of the gameplay is dedicated to avoiding the many traps and hazards Roger will meet on his way. Some actions must be performed quickly in order to prevent Roger from getting killed.</plot>

    <plot>Narrowly escaping the events of Space Quest II- Vohaul's Revenge, Roger Wilco's escape pod floats through space. As just another metallic item of junk, it's soon picked up by an interstellar garbage hauler. Waking up in a pile of trash, quite familiar for this janitor-turned-hero, Roger Wilco must somehow escape. Once given access to the rest of the galaxy, he'll soon find himself having to avoid a collections cyborg for payments overdue, dealing with the corporate prison of software company Scummsoft, and having to digest the greasy food from the galaxy's finest hamburger joint. Space Quest 3 is a graphical adventure. The mouse is functional for movement and inventory access, however the game primarily relies on a text parser for specific commands and manipulation of objects on screen. In addition to the regular gameplay, there are also various mini-games, such as a simple non-scrolling arcade game Astro Chicken, as well as a radar screen representation for ship-to-ship space combat.</plot>

    <plot>Following his humorous adventures in previous game, Roger Wilco is relaxing at his favorite pub somewhere in time and space when heavily armed soldiers enter the room. Carrying a parting message from Rogers old nemesis, Sludge Vohaul, they plan to get rid of the janitorial hero, execution style. That is, until a man with an over-sized hair dryer helps Roger escape through a time rip into the future. Now Roger Wilco has woken up on his home planet, some time in a meta-fictional Space Quest XII. It is a grim, dystopian future: the series has gone to ruin without its hero, and Vohaul rules supreme. Roger must find a way to avoid Vohauls henchmen, fulfill his destiny, and learn about a few surprises that await him in his own future.</plot>

    <plot>Following his humorous adventures in previous game, Roger Wilco is relaxing at his favorite pub somewhere in time and space when heavily armed soldiers enter the room. Carrying a parting message from Rogers old nemesis, Sludge Vohaul, they plan to get rid of the janitorial hero, execution style. That is, until a man with an over-sized hair dryer helps Roger escape through a time rip into the future. Now Roger Wilco has woken up on his home planet, some time in a meta-fictional Space Quest XII. It is a grim, dystopian future: the series has gone to ruin without its hero, and Vohaul rules supreme. Roger must find a way to avoid Vohauls henchmen, fulfill his destiny, and learn about a few surprises that await him in his own future.</plot>

    <plot>After travelling back and forth through time in the previous game, Roger Wilco is back in the Starfleet Acadamy, serving as both a cadet and a janitor. Cheating his way through the Starfleet Aptitude Test, Roger is finally given the rank of captain, his own ship (a garbage scow) and a mission- to explore strange new worlds (which no man in his right mind would explore), to seek out new life and new civilizations (which grew out of the massive amounts of trash Roger will collect on his way), to boldly go where no man has gone before. Step by step Roger will have to unveil a galaxy-wide biohazardous material dumping scheme, solve the mystery of the disappearance of a fellow Starfleet captain and his ship, and confront an agent of an old nemesis. Space Quest V- The Next Mutation is an adventure game in the Space Quest series. Like its brethren, it is characterized by humorous writing and situations, as well as plenty of opportunities for the hero to die horribly. The game is entirely mouse-controlled- the player interacts with the world by clicking on locations, people and objects on the screen, cycling between various actions (walking, looking, touching or taking, talking, etc.), by clicking the right mouse button or using the icon bar. The latter also contains icons that allow the player to access Roger's inventory, quit the game or change the settings. Commands for smelling and tasting have been removed, but a special icon for giving orders has been added. It can be used on any object or character in the game, but its actual purpose is to issue specific commands to the crew members- Roger's garbage scow, the Eureka, has a crew over which he presides. The game is plot-driven and contains cutscenes done in a comic book-like style. Plot development is linear, but each planet the protagonist visits usually consists of several screens and contains its own objectives and puzzles. There are also hazardous situations that may occur on the spaceship itself and must be dealt with.</plot>

    <plot>The playable demo of Space Quest 6 contains a short unique scenario that is not part of the adventure in the full game.[CR]The demo starts with Roger Wilco already demoted to janitor aboard DeepShip 86. While he is performing cleaning duties outside the ship, it is approached by a mysterious Escher cube shaped vessel, and subsequently boarded by the Bjorn, a spoof of Star Treks Borg (this is a reference to tennis player Bjorn Borg). The Bjorn proceed to transform all crew members into what is referred to by the game as lemon sorbet, then begin the process of assimilation. All the while Roger remains undetected as he watches helplessly the fate of his comrades.[CR]The playable part starts as Roger gets back on board. There are several puzzles to solve before DeepShip 86's crew can be saved, spanning across the key areas of the vessel, including the bridge, Roger's quarters, the mess hall and the docking bay. The game is complete with voice-over narration and Rogers voiced lines. The option to save and load the game is disabled because the demo scenario is short and not very difficult.</plot>

    <plot>The 7th Guest, produced by Trilobyte and originally released by Virgin Games in 1993, is an interactive movie puzzle adventure game. It was one of the first computer video games to be released only on CD-ROM. The 7th Guest is a horror story told from the unfolding perspective of the player, as an amnesiac. The game received a great amount of press attention for making live action video clips a core part of its gameplay, for its unprecedented amount of pre-rendered 3D graphics, and for its adult content. In addition, the game was very successful, with over two million copies sold, and is widely regarded as a killer app that accelerated the sales of CD-ROM drives. The 7th Guest has subsequently been re-released on Apples app store for various systems such as the Mac. Bill Gates called The 7th Guest the new standard in interactive entertainment.</plot>

    <plot>After a devastating atomic war, the world population was nearly annihilated, and the survivors had to hide deep underground. In the meantime, a peaceful race of human-like creatures, the boozooks, populated the Earth. After the humans ascended to the surface again, they started a bloody war against this race. The boozooks were mercilessly destroyed, their culture demolished, and in the end of the war they were enslaved by humans. The vertical, economically self-sufficient city of Vlurxtrznbnaxl was erected, controlled by a corrupt leader known as BigWig, who oppressed population with heavy taxes and freedom restrictions. The genius Professor Azimuth, sympathetic to the cause of the boozooks, has discovered a mysterious object or entity known as the Schnibble, which apparently could bring peace and prosperity to the world. However, BigWig's henchmen kidnap the professor and even shoot a teddy bear that belongs to his little adopted half-boozook son Woodruff. Applying a device called Viblefrotzer to himself, Woodruff physically ages fifteen years, and feels strong enough to begin a search for his foster father and find a way to dethrone BigWig. Woodruff is an adventure game with a cartoon-like appearance and many tricky puzzles, similar in art style and design to the Gobliiins series by the same creators. Unlike Gobliiins, this is a full-fledged adventure where the player character can move around freely, explore the large city, and interact with many characters. The interaction with the environment is done with a simple point-and-click system, without separate verb commands. The majority of the puzzles are inventory based; beside items, Woodruff can also use various spells (such as, for example, levitation) as well as ancient boozook formulae, which he has to learn and collect in order to advance in the game.</plot>

    <plot>The Orient Express is about to depart from Paris to Constantinople. As the train slowly begins to move away from the station, a young, courageously looking man jumps on it from his motorcycle and makes his way inside. This man is an American doctor named Robert Cath, escaping from authorities as a suspect in the murder of a policeman. In the train, he finds the dead body of the person he was supposed to meet. Now he has to act quickly. The only way not to arise the suspicions of the police is to disguise himself as the murdered man. A very dangerous investigation begins, and the hero soon finds himself involved in a deep net of personal intrigues and political conspiracies.[CR]The Last Express is a real-time adventure game set in 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the World War, in a concrete historical and geographical environment. The game uses a simple point-and-click interface for interacting with people and objects, and navigating the character from a first-person perspective through pre-rendered backgrounds. From the moment the player gains control of Robert Cath, time begins to flow. If the player fails to solve a part of the mystery until the train arrives at the next station, certain events the player was supposed to prevent will occur, ending the game prematurely. It is impossible to permanently die in the game, as the player has the ability to rewind the clock in order to replay a specific period of time.</plot>

    <plot>Years later, Zanthia, a young female alchemist and wizard encountered in the first game, discovers that the kingdom of Kyrandia is in great danger, disappearing piece by piece. The Mystics hold a meeting, and The Hand (a giant glove serving as an assistant to Marko, one of the Mystics) formulates a plan, which requires a magic anchor stone from the center of the world. He chooses Zanthia to be the one who shall recover the stone. As it turns out, however, the quest for the anchor stone is a snipe hunt, used by The Hand to distract Zanthia and the other Mystics while it enacts its evil deeds. The Hand, supposedly a fragment of a long-deceased gigantic evil sorcerer, is the games true villain, and Zanthia must defeat him by the end. This game was characterized by far more whimsical humor than its predecessor.</plot>

    <plot>Everyone blamed the jester Malcolm for allegedly turning everyone to stone and killing the King and the Queen of Kyrandia. Their son Brandon eventually turned Malcolm himself into stone. However, a thunderbolt strikes the jester, liberating him from his predicament. Now it's his turn to tell the world his version of the truth, whether in his usual mischievous manner or by becoming a nicer person.Malcolm's Revenge is the third entry in the Legend of Kyrandia series and, like its predecessors, an adventure game focusing on inventory-based puzzles. The basic gameplay is similar to the previous entries: the "smart cursor" is responsible for all the actions in the game - taking, using, talking, etc. During conversations, it is possible to control Malcolm's level of truthfulness as well as his "good" and "bad" attitude. Many puzzles in the game have multiple solutions, though the main story remains unchanged for the most part.</plot>

    <plot>In October of 1889, the formula for a new and extraordinarily powerful explosive disappeared from the Ministry of Defense. Sherlocks brother Mycroft, an eccentric but influential government servant, launched an official though secret inquiry into the theft, but his effort was thwarted. Just before asking Sherlock to undertake an independent investigation of the theft, Mycroft was seriously injured in an explosion that leveled the Diogenes Club. Sherlock, believing his brother had been victimized by a random gas leak, retired disconsolate to 221B Baker St. Dr. Watson, with a little luck and much effort, managed to reanimate his friend by posing one critical question: What if the explosion that injured Mycroft had not been an accident? The answer to this query sent Holmes down a long and twisted road of discovery. Sherlock, for the first time in his career, acknowledged that his motivation was something other than a desire for justice. With single-minded ferocity he pursued, cajoled, questioned, and confronted suspects from smug Mayfair to the pitiful and dangerous East End. Gradually, through observation and deduction, he developed a picture of a huge criminal enterprise initiated by a masterful adversary. To penetrate this perilous conspiracy and frustrate its intent he solved several capital crimes. Holmes applied his customary courage, acumen, and intelligence to these daunting tasks. In so doing he quashed a potentially volatile international incident, defended the national security, protected the honor of the royal family, exonerated the innocent and delivered rough and swift punishment to the guilty. The shocking and surprising resolution of the case made it necessary to seal Watsons precious account for 100 years. That is how The Case of the Rose Tattoo became one of the Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes.[CR]The Case of the Rose Tattoo is part of the Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes kept by Dr. John H. Watson and the sequel to The Case of the Serrated Scalpel. Accompany Holmes as he sets foot in 50 locations and interacts with 90 characters. All the characters are costume and speech specific to Victorian London.</plot>

    <plot>The Neverhood (also called The Neverhood Chronicles, released in Japan as Klaymen Klaymen) is a 1996 point-and-click adventure game developed by The Neverhood, Inc. and published by DreamWorks Interactive. The game follows the adventure of a claymation character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay. When the game was originally released, it was unique in that it featured all of its animation done entirely in claymation, including all of the sets, rather than 2- or 3-dimensional computer graphics, like many other games at its time. The gameplay consists mostly of the player guiding the main character Klaymen around and solving puzzles to advance in the game. As the player advances through different areas of the game, there are various video sequences that help advance the plot. In addition to being unique, The Neverhood aimed at being quirky and humorous, as is evident by the characters, the music, and the plot sequence of the game.</plot>

    <plot>Toonstruck is an adventure game released in 1996. The game features hand-drawn imagery and animated characters, but the protagonist Drew Blanc (played and voiced by actor Christopher Lloyd) is represented as a video-captured live action character interacting with the cartoon world around him. Toonstruck also features scan-line compressed FMV, including several animated sequences produced by Nelvana and Rainbow Animation, and was also one of the first video games to include stock music from APM Music, notably the classic Spooky Scherzo by Sam Fonteyn and Lonely Hearts Club A by David Bell.</plot>

    <plot>Curse the quick thinking of the Arch Authority, snatching the child away before his doom was sealed. Had the lad been with the rest, surely my suffering would have ceased years ago. At last I have found him, but in a world of isolation and innocence. He has no idea of the twists and turns his life has taken thus far, nor the path I have planned for his very short future. Just let him try to discover the truth, and learn the secrets of Stratas five nested worlds. Watching his struggle will be an amusement. Facing him will be horribly wonderful.[CR]Torins Passage is a game for children, but like all really good games, books, and movies with similar target audience it also has that knowing wink towards older audience, and the best thing about this game is that it “winks” a lot. This is clearly one the the best adventure games from Sierra, made by a fantastic team that included talents such as Al Lowe and Michel Legrand. So if you are an adventure games fan this is a no-brainer. If not so much, then try it anyway because everyone can use a good laugh and this game is filled with hilarity.</plot>

At the moment he arrives, the unfortunate Comte d’Itee, William de Peuple, is attacked by bandits and his precious will is stolen. Geoffroi offers him, just before he dies, his assistance to find his will.[CR]Of course, getting it back will not be easy, and he must travel back and forth across France to accomplish his quest, visiting the cities of Amiens, St Quentin, Le Mans, Paris, and Le Havre. However, he is assisted by a clever manservant, called Henri, who will be a great help, without any doubt. With some luck, he will hunt the murderer(s) down and find the will. And who knows, maybe he will meet a beautiful lady or find a fortune on the way.[CR]Touché: The Adventures of the Fifth Musketeer is a humorous, inventory-based point and click adventure game. By right-clicking on a hotspot a context-sensitive action interface pops up, showing the relevant actions. The game is a full talkie with captions, music and sound effects.

    <plot>This point and click adventure takes a fantasy setting, in which you play a Wizard deemed to be ‘good’ taking on a less good one. To fulfill the prophecy you have been given in a limited time of 3 days, he must go on 3 quests, solving various puzzles along the way to be rewarded 3 grains of sand, that he must place in a hourglass to kill an evil wizard. Objects around the levels are always detected by the cursor, making each screen and the challenges within quick to comprehend. Generally you have to solve each puzzle in sequence.[CR]Like the company's Gobliins Series, the interface is simplified, and the game has a heavier focus on self-sufficient puzzles than other traditional adventures. The game experiments with the toning of the graphics, using a faux-sepia style outside and some bright colours inside, which changes the atmosphere somewhat.</plot>

    <plot>Magic is banned in the Great Underground Empire, and the Grand Inquisitor Yannick (with the kind help of Frobozz Electric) has a stranglehold on the world of Zork, establishing a totalitarian regime. According to his own words, the goal of the new state is to shun magic, shun the appearance of magic, shun everything, and then shun shunning. Any opposing forces will be totemized, which is apparently a rather unpleasant procedure. The player character in the game is just that - the player character: Ageless, Faceless, Gender-Neutral, Culturally-Ambiguous Adventure Person (abbreviated AFGNCAAP), as the politically correct designation by the Dungeon Master Dalboz defines him/her (it?). Naturally, it is the heros duty to save the world by collecting a Cube of Foundation, the Skull of Yoruk, and the Coconut of Quendor, so that magic can return to the land and the Grand Inquisitor falls victim to his own shunning policies.[CR]Zork: Grand Inquisitor is the third in the row of graphical Zork games. It utilizes the same engine as its predecessor, with first-person perspective, 180 degree camera rotation, pre-rendered backgrounds, and live actors. Compared to the previous game, it is more similar in tone to the early, predominantly humorous Zork adventures, containing plenty of references to them.</plot>

    <plot>Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands is a graphical first person adventure game in the style of Myst, mixing logic puzzles with live-action FMV sequences which advance the story. The player views each location from a first-person perspective, and can rotate the camera 180 degrees to get a full view of your surroundings.[CR]Like other Zork installments, the game contains humorous elements, but in general its story and atmosphere are darker, including images and themes such as decapitated heads and human sacrifice.</plot>
